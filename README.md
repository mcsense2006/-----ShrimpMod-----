Morshu_Theme.ogg original :  Molatro (Balatro Theme Morshu Cover) by 123connorpooop (https://youtu.be/s-3QJxcurlY?list=RDs-3QJxcurlY). This mod is currently in a develloppement stage, all depicted sprites are subject to change on future patches.
# About 1x assets
We fully recommand players to use this mod with the "Pixel Art Smoothing" settings on. As we created all the assets with a 2x base, the quality of the 1x sprite will be very lowered (blurry) because of the edit.
# Dependencies :
-  Steamodded (1.0.0~BETA-0711a-STEAMODDED)
